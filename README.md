# Fix The Web

> Let's fix it together.. One line at a time!

## What is this?

If you are [persnickety](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/persnickety) like I am, you can easily fix quite a few things and at the same time contribute to your favorite project. It's never too late to start contributing instead of just consuming.

## Search and Replace

### Recommended renames

We recommend to submit each of the following possible fixes in a separate Pull Request.

- `Github` => `GitHub`
- `Javascript` => `JavaScript`
- `OSX`, `OS X`, `MacOS` => `macOS`

### Yes, but how?

1. Find your [favorite project](https://github.com/trending) and Fork it
2. Clone it and open the project in your [favorite editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Search all for exact match of `Javascript` and replace it with `JavaScript`
4. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b fix-case`
5. Commit all changes: `git commit -am 'Fix case: Javascript to JavaScript'`
6. Push your changes: `git push origin fix-case`
7. Create pull request to the [original project](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9797)
8. Be polite!
